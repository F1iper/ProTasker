# :postbox: ProTasker (Java/Spring)

Welcome to the ProTasker, Java/Spring based application to manage tasks.

The application will allow users to create/update/delete tasks, sort based on category, or time due.

The application uses Spring Boot as its foundation, providing a robust and easy-to-use framework for building web applications. 
Spring Security with JWT will used to handle authentication.

The application includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing tasks/categories and appUser accounts. 
Users will be able to add/search tasks. 

### :wrench: Application is under development.

Currently the application allows these operations:
- create/read/update/delete tasks without authentication.
